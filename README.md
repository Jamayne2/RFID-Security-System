# RFID-Security-System

This project showcases a small-scale security system built using RFID and Arduino technology. The system allows users to use RFID keycards for secure room access, featuring robust access control mechanisms to authenticate users. With a focus on safety and convenience, the system was rigorously tested, achieving a 95% success rate in access authentication during trials.

Features:
RFID-based Access: Users can unlock rooms using secure RFID keycards.
User Authentication: Implemented secure access control to verify users.
High Reliability: Achieved 95% success rate in authentication during testing.

Technologies Used:
Arduino for controlling the RFID reader and managing access logic.
C++ for programming the Arduino and handling the authentication process.
